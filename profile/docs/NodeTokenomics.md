# Node Operator Economics

Node operators form the backbone of DataHive's decentralized infrastructure, providing essential services through specialized node types while earning rewards for their contributions.

## Node Types

### Legalese Nodes
- **Primary Functions**
  - Process legal data
  - Maintain legal intelligence
  - Update regulatory frameworks
- **Reward Structure**
  - Base rewards for uptime
  - Performance bonuses
  - Legal intelligence contributions

### Consent Nodes
- **Primary Functions**
  - Manage consent records
  - Process permission updates
  - Track usage rights
- **Reward Structure**
  - Transaction fees
  - Consent processing rewards
  - Compliance bonuses

### Data Assetization Nodes
```javascript
// Node configuration example
const assetizationNode = new DataHive.Node({
    type: 'assetization',
    performance: {
        minThroughput: '1000tps',
        uptime: '99.9%'
    },
    rewards: {
        autoCompound: true
    }
});
```

## Node Operator Economics

### Monitoring and Performance Metrics
In the DataHive ecosystem, the reliability of nodes is paramount. Each node operator is subject to strict performance metrics that must be met to ensure network stability. We employ a rigorous monitoring system that evaluates uptime, response times, and accuracy of data handling.

### Fallback Mechanisms
To enhance reliability, we have implemented fallback mechanisms. If a node fails to respond or meets certain performance thresholds, tasks can automatically switch to a backup node to ensure continuous service delivery. This redundancy significantly minimizes risks associated with unreliable node operations and boosts overall network performance.

Additionally, **nodes that do not meet performance standards may face slashing**, reduced rewards, or replacement in the network.
