The **DataHive Token (DH)** powers a dynamic ecosystem where enterprises, individuals, and AI agents can participate in secure, compliant data exchange while ensuring privacy and ownership rights.

## Token Flow by Participant Type

### Enterprises
- **Spend DH tokens to**:
  - Purchase or license consumer data directly from users
  - Access high-resolution consumer insights
  - Deploy targeted marketing campaigns
- **Earn DH tokens by**:
  - Selling their own packaged data assets
  - Offering valuable consumer insights
  - Contributing to the ecosystem's intelligence and knowledge models

### Individuals
- **Earn DH tokens by**:
  - Packaging and selling data assets
  - Licensing data rights 
  - Setting granular permissions for data usage
- **Control their data through**:
  - Selective data sharing options
  - Revenue-sharing in downstream uses

### AI Agents
- **Spend DH tokens to**:
  - Execute LLM operations and model inference
  - Access computational resources across the network
  - Interface with other AI agents and systems
- **Earn DH tokens by**:
  - Providing intelligent bridging services
  - Contributing to swarm intelligence
  - Optimizing cross-network operations

### AI Agent Swarms
- **Dynamic Bridge Formation**:
  - Self-organizing agent clusters that facilitate cross-ecosystem interactions
  - Automated interface creation between Web2 and Web3 systems
  - Adaptive routing of data and computational resources
- **Token Economics**:
  - DH tokens serve as both computational credits and value transfer medium
  - Dual-purpose tokenization: LLM operations and economic incentives
  - Dynamic pricing based on computational complexity and network demand

### Developers
- **Spend DH tokens to**:
  - Access intelligence and knowledge models
  - Utilize network APIs and services
  - Deploy applications on the network
- **Earn DH tokens by**:
  - Creating applications and tools
  - Contributing to ecosystem development
  - Building new data assetization solutions

- **Legalese Nodes**: Earn by developing and maintaining DataHive's legal intelligence
- **Consent Nodes**: Earn by developing and maintaining the network's consent intelligence
- **Data Assetization Nodes**: Earn by developing and maintaining agentic marketplaces
- **Data Securitization Nodes**: Earn by processing data assets into securities

## Cross-Layer Token Dynamics

### Agentic Layer Interactions
- **Horizontal Integration**:
  - Agent-to-agent token transfers
  - Cross-model computation settlement
  - Swarm coordination incentives
- **Vertical Integration**:
  - Layer-specific token utilities
  - Cross-layer bridging rewards
  - Ecosystem growth incentives

### LLM Token Economics
- **Token Conversion**:
  - LLM computational tokens â†” DH tokens
  - Dynamic pricing based on model complexity
  - Efficiency rewards for optimized operations


## Regenerative Economics

DataHive's tokenomics emphasizes sustainable growth through:
- Continuous value creation through data generation and data assetization
- External capital inflows from pure users of the network
- Self-sustaining cryptoeconomic mechanisms
