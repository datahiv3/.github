# Privacy by Design

**Privacy by Design** is a fundamental principle of the DataHive ecosystem, ensuring that every layer of our technology prioritizes user privacy and data protection. It's not just a feature but a foundational pillar that shapes all aspects of the design and development process. From local data processing to secure consent management, DataHive ensures that users have full control over their personal information at all times.

## Key Features

- **User Control**: Users maintain full control over their data within the DataHive ecosystem. They decide how their data is used, shared, or stored, ensuring complete autonomy.
  
- **Default Settings**: Privacy settings are configured to be the most privacy-friendly by default. Users must give explicit consent for any data sharing or external processing.

- **Minimal Data Collection**: DataHive only collects the minimal amount of data necessary for functionality. This reduces potential risks associated with data breaches or unauthorized access.

## Implementation of Privacy by Design

### 1. Local Data Processing
DataHive processes data locally on the user's device, ensuring that sensitive information never leaves the device unless absolutely necessary. This approach minimizes exposure to external threats and ensures that users retain control over their personal information.

### 2. Secure Consent Management
DataHive uses **Consent Nodes** to manage user permissions and ensure compliance with global privacy regulations like GDPR. These nodes allow users to grant or revoke consent at any time, giving them full control over how their data is used within the ecosystem.

### 3. Transparent Practices
Transparency is at the core of DataHiveâ€™s operations. All data-handling practices are fully transparent, allowing users to see how their data is being used at any given time. Users can also revoke consent or request modifications to their data whenever they choose.
